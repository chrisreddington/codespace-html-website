# Hello World Website in a Codespace

This repository contains a "Hello World" website built using HTML and CSS.

## Development Environment

The development environment is configured using a GitHub Codespace with a devcontainer. The website can be accessed on port 3000. The devcontainer setup ensures that all necessary dependencies and configurations are in place for a smooth development experience.

## Devcontainer Configuration

For this simple HTML/CSS website, the devcontainer is configured to serve the site on port 3000 within the GitHub Codespace. This setup may be useful for static websites and basic web development.

For more complex scenarios, such as Node.js applications or other server-side technologies, an alternate devcontainer configuration may be required. Each type of application may have specific dependencies and setup requirements that need to be addressed in the devcontainer configuration.

If you are interested in learning more, you should check out the [GitHub Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/codespaces).

### Running the site

- The Codespace installs [Microsoft's Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) so that you can preview the website in real-time as you make changes. Note the FAQ about Codespaces, and that you might need to initially load the page and click on a button to approve the content comes from a Codespace.
